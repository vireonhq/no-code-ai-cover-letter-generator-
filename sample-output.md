Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Content Marketing Intern position at XYZ Media. As a marketing graduate with hands-on experience from two internships, I’ve developed strong content creation and storytelling skills tailored to digital platforms.

At my last internship, I led a blog campaign that increased organic traffic by 40%. I also enjoy breaking down complex topics into relatable content that connects with young audiences — something I admire in XYZ Media's voice.

I’d love to bring my enthusiasm and creative energy to your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Best,  
[Your Name]
